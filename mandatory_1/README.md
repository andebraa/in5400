All code belonging to project is placed in prelimcode. All paths should be relative to that,
unless i've fucked up.
The only exception is perfmeasure_plot which simply produces a couple of plots from
the ssh_copy files

ssh_copy is simply pulls from the ml7 runs, incase you with to see them.

The raport is placed in in5400_oblig1.pdf.
Dependencies shouldn't be nothing out of the ordinary.
