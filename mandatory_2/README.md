All tasks have a seperate folder with a corresponding name.
Inside should be a coco file, which is a modification of the original coco trainig file, and a Excersice_training file which trains the model. NOTE, if you run this it will overwrite the model!

validate_only files calls the validation.py in utils and saves a random picture with a caption. Should be a folder called photos with some of theese already in there.
